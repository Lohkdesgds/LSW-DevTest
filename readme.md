# LSW v5
This is a huge library I've been working on since 2019. It's a graphic almost fully complete project to do any 2D stuff, like games, applications and stuff online, based on the Allegro library.

## Latest releases
THIS REPO IS NOT USED FOR RELEASES ANYMORE! PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT [THIS ONE](https://github.com/Lohkdesgds/LSW). This is more like a experimental repo that I make sure everything works. This also build the libs in the LSW.

<hr>

### Licensing LSW v5
I may allow you to use the library 'as is' if you want to, but please ask me first on Discord (https://discord.gg/JkzJjCG, I'm Lohk#3942) or Twitter (https://www.twitter.com/lohkdesgds).
You can try it out if you want to, but to share your work done with it, please ask me first. Seriously, I just want to know who is using it, and I want you to credit me somewhere in your application. Talk to me first if you want no trouble.

### About updates and new features
I will keep the project up to date as far as I can get. I'll try my best to keep it alive, but I cannot guarantee that it will live forever. It might live.

<hr>

### Allegro
Allegro has a giftware license (https://liballeg.org/license.html), and I'm using an unmodified version of it (always the latest update available on Visual Studio).

<hr>

### My rights
GitHub says that I don't have to do a license like GNU or MIT (https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/). I want it more like "readonly" right now.
